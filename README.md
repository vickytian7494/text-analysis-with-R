# Text Analysis With R - Customer Reviews Analysis

As part of the hospitality industry, hotels highly focus on intangible product quality: customer service. Customer feedback plays an integral part in guiding hotels in operational improvement and customer experience personalization. Many studies have addressed the role of online reviews in influencing the hotel industry overall, but few have investigated online travel platforms for an individual hotel's customer reviews.

I am passionate about the intersection between business analytics and the hotel industry, especially regarding applying technical analytics to understand customer behavior and discover potential business opportunities. Customer feedbacks play an important part in guiding hotel operation improvement. 

This paper showcases analyzing Trip Advisor and Yelp customer reviews for a luxury hotel in California. The study consists of two parts: first, I focus on online reviews with low customer satisfaction ratings and identify features frequently associated with low ratings. Applying the embedding technique, I find words associated with these features to discover what causes low satisfaction. The second part of the study analyzes a specific segment: customers celebrating anniversary. I summarize their sentiments towards high frequent mentioned hotel service/amenities based on the aspect grouping and sentiment analysis. Including those keywords and highlighting related amenities in the hotel celebration package or the website would make the promotion more appealing to this customer segment group.

The first section covers the natural language techniques used in this paper: term frequency analysis, sentiment analysis, and word correlation analysis. It is followed by the data collection section, which outlines data sources, descriptions, and dataset sizes. The summary statistics section discusses the analysis results, summarizes the derived conclusions, and raises suggestions based on the statistic outcomes. The limitation and future research section discuss the potential further steps after this current approach.
