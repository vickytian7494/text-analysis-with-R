# Text Analysis With R - Customer Reviews Analysis

Hotels as part of the service industry are highly focused on the quality of the intangible products: customer service. Online travel forums have become extremely popular for sharing information. With the recent rise of social networks and a large number of reviews being posted daily, the hotel industry has access to a large and growing number of online customer reviews from the travel portals. Hoteliers can use these data to generate insights about their customers and understand what their values are, and ultimately, to discover potential opportunities of hotel operation improvements and personalize customer service.

I am passionate about the intersection between business analytics and the hotel industry, especially regarding applying technical analytics to understand customer behavior and discover potential business opportunities. Customer feedbacks play an important part in guiding hotel operation improvement. Many studies have addressed the role of online reviews in influencing hotel operation, but few studies have considered investigating individual hotel property’s review content. In this paper, I am keen on applying statistical methods and text-mining techniques to an individual hotels’ customer reviews and US census data, which will help understand different customer segments’ values, recognize opportunities for personalized customer services, and yield insights regarding hotel promotions and operational approaches that most efficient to certain customer segment.

This paper showcases analyzing customer reviews data from the HMB Ritz-Carlton hotel and the United States population and migration data from the US Census. The study grouped reviews based on different customer segments and compared the rating difference among groups. This provided a full picture of hotel customer segment structures and how their general experience of the hotel stay. The study then focused on reviews with low ratings and found features that frequently associated with low rating reviews. The study also analyzes a specific segment group: anniversary travelers, and summarized their preferences towards various aspects of the hotel operation. The second part of the study concentrate on discovering market opportunity by exploring US population migration data from the US Census. By comparing average income change from migration, the study found high-income groups migration patterns. This finding pointed states that have growing potential customers, which could help understand market potential.
